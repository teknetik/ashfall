# Editing Athen Hill in Unity

Engine editability is a project requirement, added by the user on 7 September 2026.

The port must save an ordinary Unity scene, modular prefab instances, materials,
animation assets and editable UI assets. Gameplay scripts expose tuning in the
Inspector. Dialogue, prices, NPC placement and routes belong in serialized data.
The city must not be recreated by a runtime scene-generation script.

Import/assembly helpers are Editor-only conveniences. Once a scene exists,
assembly must refuse to overwrite it. Subsequent changes use normal scene/prefab
editing or narrowly scoped operations. Original imported GLBs remain intact;
make prefab/material variants for adaptations. Generated render batches, if
needed, retain their editable source objects and have an explicit rebuild action.
Do not silently overwrite user edits or replace the city with one mega-mesh.

Current checkpoint: U0 passed. U1 import baseline is being assembled. Full editing
instructions will be added as each gameplay and UI asset is introduced.
